    "## Variables Revisited\n",
    "Think of variables as values with names; those names describe what those values represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables appear within our Python programs under one of these three usages:\n",
    "1. To declare and set a value to the variable. \n",
    "2. To assign the the variable to a new value (object)\n",
    "3. Use the variable - whether in an expression or outputting the value in same fashion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we declare a variable, remember that the name must be a legal identifier: The variable name must start with a letter or an underscore.  The variable name only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.  The variable name can not be one of Python's reserved words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we use a variable, we must declare it first and assign some value to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign a value to a variable, we use an assignment operator:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "a = 45 * 10\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "Programmers read that line of code as \"set a to the value of 45 times 10\" or \"a is assigned <i>expression</i>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time a value is assigned to a variable is also known as initializing the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a variable has been assigned a value or to an existing object, that variable can then be used in other statements and expressions."
