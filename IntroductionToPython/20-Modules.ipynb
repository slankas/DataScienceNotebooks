Without the `__init__.py`, the package is considered an [implicit namespace package](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/). The technical details between regular packages and implicit namespace packages are irrelevant for most use cases, but issues generally arise when the same package name is used in more than one location in the search path (see below on \"How imports works\") - [view more details].(https://web.archive.org/web/20220605062021/http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html)  Note: these links are provided for informational purposes only.\n",

While having to type <code><i>module.</i></code> is a bit more tedious, it makes your code extremely clear as to where an object originated.\n",
