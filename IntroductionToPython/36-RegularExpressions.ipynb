    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at two closely related concepts: finite automata and regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite automata (FA) are an abstract concept, but often have real-world counterparts. FA contain a number of states that a given system may have.  Between the different states exist transitions that allow the system to move from one system to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is the traffic lights at a intersection. Below we have Main Street intersecting with First Avenue. There are two sets of traffic lights - $L_A$ and $L_B$.  Behind the scenes, four states exist.  $S_0$ allows traffic on First Avenue to have the right of way.  If a transition occurs - $\\overline{T_A}$ - either from a sensor or timer), then the system to move state $S_1$ where the light becomes yellow.  After a timer, the system then moves to $S_2$."

    "- $\\Sigma$ is a finite set of symbols (i.e., the alphabet). $x$ is an input symbol.  $x \\in \\Sigma$\n",
    "- $\\delta$ : $ S \\times \\Sigma \\rightarrow S$ is the transition function. The inputs to this function are the current state $s$ and the current input symbol $x$, the result is the resulting state $s_n$.  \n",
    "- $s_0$ is the starting state for the finite automata.\n",
    "- $A$ is the set of accepting states for the automata.  If the automata is in one of these states after reading all of the input, then the automata outputs \"yes\" and accepts the input.  If the automata is not in one of these states after consuming the input, the output is \"no\" and the input is rejected.   $A \\subseteq S$"

    "One way that we can represent the logic within this program is through a finite automata.  In this scenario, we have two states - is the program currently processing a characters inside a word or outside (not in) a word. Three groups of characters exist: $C_N$ - a new line, $C_{notword}$ - a character that cannot form a word (e.g., space or tab), and $C_{word}$ - characters that can be part of a word. "
