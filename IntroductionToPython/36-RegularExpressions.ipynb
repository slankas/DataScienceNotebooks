    "In this notebook, we will look at two closely related concepts: finite automata and regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite automata (FA) are an abstract concept, but often have real-world counterparts. FA contain a number of states that a given system may have.  Among the different states exist transitions that allow the system to move from one state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is the traffic lights at a intersection. Below we have Main Street intersecting with First Avenue. Two sets of traffic lights - $L_A$ and $L_B$ exist.  Behind the scenes, four states exist for this \"system\".  $S_0$ allows traffic on First Avenue to have the right of way.  If a transition occurs - $\\overline{T_A}$ - either from a sensor or timer), then the system to move state $S_1$ where the light becomes yellow.  After a timer finishes, the system then moves to $S_2$."

    "In this final example, we show the finite automata for `(ab)*`.  As before, we start at state `0`.  However this state also functions as the acceptance state as we are looking for `ab` repeated zero or more times. From this state, `a` transitions to state `1`. Then from state `1`, `b` transitions back to state `0`. Any unexpected output sends the system to `2` which consumes all further input."
