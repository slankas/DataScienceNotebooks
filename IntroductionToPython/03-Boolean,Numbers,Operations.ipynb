We can create variables to hold one of these values directly, but will also implicitly use this type as the result of conditional expressions to evaluate whether or not something is true or false.  Typically, these results will be used in control (```if```) and loop (```while```) statements.\n",

    "### Bases\n",
    "Integers are genrally represented in programs as base 10 (decimal) numbers.  The *base* is the number of digits that a system of counting uses to represent numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, computers largely rely upon sequences of bits (zeros and ones) to represent values.  As humans, we rely upon abstractions to make sense of those sequences.  There are three base representations that are often used within computer science and you may use or see these representations in your code or elsewhere.\n",

    "For Python, we can express literal integers in the following 3 basis in addition to decimal by using specific prefixes:\n",
    "- 0b or 0B for *binary* (base 2).  Digits: 0, 1\n",
    "- 0o or 0O for *octal* (base 8).  Digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n",
    "- 0x or 0X for *hexadecimal* (base 16).  Often this is shortened to \"hex\".  Digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f\n",
    "\n",
    "These prefixes are the reason why we can not start integer values with 0 and then some other series of digits. As part of the process of translating program text to something that can be executed, a tokenizer \"chunks\" up terms of program text.  The Python tokenizer has the ability to correctly determine the chucks for 0 and 0xFF, but not for 01."
