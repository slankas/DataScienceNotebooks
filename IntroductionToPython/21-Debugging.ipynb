    "# Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Four people were riding in the car when care breaks down and coasts to the side of the road. The first person - a chemical engineer - states, \"hmmmm.  We may have gotten in some bad gasoline when stopped. Let me test it to be sure its correct.  The second individual - a mechanical engineer - states, \"I thought I heard some knocking from the engine.  Let me take a look at that and we should be back on the road soon.\"  The third person - an electrical engineer, states, \"That was really odd the car stopped suddenly. That could be a sign that the electrical system has an issue.  Let me check that and I'll get us going again in a minute.\"  The final person - a computer scientist says, \"Why don't we just all get out of the car, change seats, get back in, and see if the car starts.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "While humorous, an underlying lesson exists in this joke - the need to gather evidence, make educated guesses about what has occurred (hypothesize), and then test (experiment) to see if that guess was correct or not when diagnosing a problem.  The first three individuals followed that process while the last attempt just to do something randomly. While \"restarting the system\" often solves many computer-related system issues (what the restart process really does is force the system to re-initialize and place itself into a consistent), it is not a process for fixing issues with programs. We cannot just re-run the program and fiercely hope that program works - that's the definition of insanity - doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  (The last line is often misattributed to Albert Einstein.).  As we debug(fix) our programs, we need to do so in a systematic fashion - not just randomly make coding changes until things just work.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Additional side note: Couple of additional lessons exist in the joke.  The four individuals bring a diversity of thought to the problem at hand - looking at different causes for a particular problem.  Unfortunately, they also demonstrated an [egocentric bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_bias) where they relied heavily upon their own backgrounds in making guesses as to what is occurring with the car.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We troubleshoot problems regularly in our daily lives - phone not working, car not start, lights not on, toaster. For instance, if a toaster does not work, we implicitly follow a process to find the underlying cause and then apply a correction. Our minds gather information from the environment as well as recall past facts that we know about the toaster:\n",
    "- Does the toaster appear on?\n",
    "- Does the toaster have electricity?\n",
    "  - Is it plugged in?\n",
    "  - Is the outlet working?\n",
    "  - Is there power to the circuit?\n",
    "  - Is there power to the house?\n",
    "  - Is there power to the neighborhood\n",
    "- Are there other circumstances in which the toaster has behaved similarly?\n",
    "- Was it dropped recently?  Does the toaster have any physical damage?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the information we gather, we then make a hypothesis (an educated guess). For example, the toaster does not work because the circuit breaker flipped as too many electrical devices were drawing power at the same time in the kitchen. We then test that hypothesis by performing some action of experiment.  In the case of the toaster, we test if resetting the circuit breaker fixes the issue.  If it, great we are done.  If not, we need to gather more information and look at different possibility through an alternate hypothesis. Yes, we have applied the terms of the scientific method in this process, but that should help to demonstrate how ubiquitous the process actually is. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, debugging is very similar to troubleshooting - we want to make the debugging process as systematic as possible to most effective find and fix issues within our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you have no choice but to debug - particularly when the bug is found only when you plug the whole system together, or reported by a user after the system is deployed, in which case it may be hard to localize it to a particular module.  This notebook presents a systematic strategy for more effective debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good book about systematic debugging is [Why Programs Fail](https://www.whyprogramsfail.com/toc.php) by Andreas Zeller. Much of this notebook is inspired by that book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also related is [“How to Debug”](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/199) by John Regehr, a lecture from an embedded systems course, which is more low-level than this course but with the same general principles for systematic debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, [Debugging: The Nine Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems](https://debuggingrules.com) by David Agans is a readable, eminently practical guide to debugging in a variety of technical situations, from software to hardware to cars to plumbing. We refer to several of the [Nine Rules](https://www.debuggingrules.com/Debugging_CH2.PDF) here."

    "## Reproduce the bug\n",
    "Start by finding a small, repeatable test case that produces the failure. If the bug was found by regression testing, then you are in luck; you already have a failing test case in your test suite. If the bug was reported by a user, it may take some effort to reproduce the bug. For graphical user interfaces and multithreaded programs, a bug may be hard to reproduce consistently if it depends on timing of events or thread execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, any effort you put into making the test case small and repeatable will pay off, because you will have to run it over and over while you search for the bug and develop a fix for it. Furthermore, after you successfully fixed the bug, you will want to keep the test case in your regression test suite, so that the bug never crops up again. Once you have a test case for the bug, making this test work becomes your goal.\n",

    "## Find the bug using the scientific method\n",
    "To localize the bug and its cause, you can use the scientific method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Study the data.* Look at the test input that causes the bug, and examine the incorrect results, failed assertions, and stack traces that result from it.\n",
    "2. *Hypothesize.* Propose a hypothesis, consistent with all the data, about where the bug might be, or where it cannot be. It is good to make this hypothesis general at first.\n",
    "3. *Experiment.* Devise and run an experiment that tests your hypothesis. It is good to make the experiment an observation at first - a probe that collects information but disturbs the system as little as possible.\n",
    "4. *Repeat.* Add the data you collected from your experiment to what you knew before, and make a fresh hypothesis. Hopefully you have ruled out some possibilities and narrowed the set of possible locations and reasons for the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of deliberate process is not needed for every bug. With good fail-fast design, you will hopefully get an exception very close to the source of the bug, the stack trace will lead you right to it, and the mistake will be obvious from inspecting the code. So when do you need to apply the scientific method? A good rule of thumb is the 10-minute rule. If you have spent 10 minutes hunting for a bug using ad hoc, unsystematic inspection, then it is time to take a step back and start applying the scientific method instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this transition, you should also move your debugging process out of your head - which has a very limited working memory of what you have tried and what you have learned from it - and start taking notes, either on paper or on your laptop. In each iteration of the process, you will be writing down:\n",
    "- _Hypothesis._ Based on what you have learned so far, what is your next hypothesis about the location or cause of the bug?\n",
    "- _Experiment._ What are you about to try that will shed light on the hypothesis, by verifying or falsifying it?\n",
    "- _Predictions._ What do you expect, based on your hypothesis, to be the result of the experiment?\n",
    "- _Observations._ What actually happened when you did the experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "These kinds of questions should be very familiar to you from your past experience in science classes. In the next few sections, we will see what kind of form they take when you debug code. In debugging, some hypotheses and some experiments are better than others."

When we were slicing for the value of `bonus`, and saw that its type was a tuple, we immediately knew that we didn't have to look any further - no other lines can be in the slice for bonus, because it's a reference to an immutable value. Immutability saved us a lot of time in reasoning and searching. When we saw `s in salesList` though, we didn't have quite the same confidence. Certainly `s` could never be reassigned within the body of the loop, but if the element type of `salesList` is a mutable type, we would have to check the subsequent `...` code to make sure no mutators were called on `s` or other aliases of the `Sale` object.\n",

For example, maybe `mostCommonWords(\"c c, b\")` is broken, but `mostCommonWords(\"c c b\")` is fine. Now you can examine the difference between the execution of these two test cases to help form your hypothesis.

Using your version control system, you retrieve the most recent version that still passed the test, and then systematically explore the code-changes between the older working version and the newer failing version, until you find the change that introduced the bug. Delta debugging tools can automate this kind of search process, though like slicing tools they are not widely used yet."

    "Your hypothesis should lead to a prediction, such as \"I think variable x has a bad value at this point\" or even \"I think this code is never executed.\" Your experiment should be chosen to test the prediction. The best experiment is a probe, a gentle observation of the system that disturbs it as little as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One familiar probe is a **print statement**. Print debugging has the advantage that it works for virtually every programming language. It has the disadvantage that it makes a change to the program, which you have to remember to revert. It's too easy to end up with a program littered with print statements after a long debugging session. It's also wise to be a little thoughtful when you write a debugging print statement. Rather than printing the same hi! in fifteen different places to trace how the program is executing, and losing track of which is which, print something clear and descriptive like `start of calculateTotalBonus`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more elaborate kind of print debugging is logging, which keeps informative print statements permanently in the code and turns them on or off with a global setting or a method call.\n",
    "Python contains a built-in [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) library in its standard library.  This library provides methods such as `logging.info()`, `logging.warning()`, `logging.error()`, and `logging.critical` - representing increasingly-higher levels of importance for the message being displayed. The logging framework allows the user to filter the log output to hide less-important messages, and messages sent to the most critical log levels, like logging.error(), are often displayed in red so that they stand out regardless of the filter. Additionally, this logging framework can also direct logging to a file or to a server across the network, can log structured data as well as human-readable strings, and can be used in deployment, not just development. Large, complex systems would be very hard to operate without logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of probe is an **assertion** that tests variable values or other internal state. In the example above where x is never allowed to exceed 100, we could insert `assert(x <= 100)` as a probe at any point. Assertions have the advantage that they don't require you to inspect output by hand, and can even be left in the code after debugging if the test is universally true (some debugging assertions are only true for the specific test case you're debugging, and those would need to be removed). Assertions have the disadvantage that in many languages (such as Java), they're not turned on by default, so you can be fooled by an assertion that seems to be passing but is actually not even running. Assertions can be explicitly turned off as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third kind of probe is setting a **breakpoint** with a debugger, which stops the running program at that point, and allows you to single-step through the program and inspect values of variables. A debugger is a powerful tool that rewards the effort put into learning how to use it."

If the observation agreed with the prediction, then refine the hypothesis to narrow down the location and cause of the bug. Then repeat the process with this fresh hypothesis.\n",

    "This is one of Agans' nine rules of debugging: Keep an Audit Trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a bug takes more than a few minutes to find, or more than a couple iterations of the study-hypothesis-experiment loop, then you need to **start writing things down**, because the short-term memory in your brain will very quickly lose track of what's working and what isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep a log in a text file of what you did, in what order, and what happened as a result. Include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the hypothesis you are exploring now\n",
    "- the experiment you are trying now to test that hypothesis\n",
    "- what you observe as a result of the experiment:\n",
    "  - whether the test passed or failed this time\n",
    "  - the program output, especially your own debugging messages\n",
    "  - any stack traces\n",
    "  \n",
    "Systematic debugging techniques can rapidly exceed the ability of your brain to keep track of them, so start writing things down sooner rather than later. Minimizing a test case and delta debugging often require several iterations to zero in on an answer. If you do not write down which test case you are trying, and whether it passes or fails, then it will be hard to keep track of what you are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check the plug\n",
    "If you have been iterating on a bug and nothing makes sense, consider another of Agans' rules: Check the Plug. What this means is you should question your assumptions. For example, if you turn on the power switch of a machine, and the machine does not start, maybe you should not be debugging the switch or the machine – but asking whether the machine is even plugged in? Or whether the electrical outlet itself has power?\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of \"checking the plug\" in programming is to **make sure your source code and object code are up to date.** If none of your observations seem to make sense, one possible hypothesis is that the code you're running (the object code) does not match the code you are reading (the source). To test this, pull the latest version from the repository and recompile all your program.  This can be also a simple as making sure you are using the correct location if multiple copies of the source code exist.  Within web applications, it may be necessary to restart the server to pick up the latest changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### If YOU didn’t fix it, it isn’t really fixed\n",
    "This is another one of Agans' nine rules. In a complex system, sometimes a bug will suddenly disappear. Maybe it was something you did, but maybe not. If the system seems to be working now, and you don't know how the bug got fixed… then most likely it isn't fixed. The bug is just hiding again, masked by some change in environment, but ready to rear its ugly head again someday. We will see some examples of nasty bugs like this when we talk about concurrency, later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systematic debugging helps build confidence that a bug is really fixed, and not just temporarily hidden. This is why you first reproduce the bug, so that you have seen the system in a failing state. Then you understand the cause of the bug without fixing it yet. Then finally apply a change to fix the bug using your knowledge of the cause. To gain confidence that you have really fixed it, you want to see that your change caused the system to transition from failing to working, and understand why."

    "## Fix the Bug\n",
    "Once you find the bug and understand its cause, the third step is to devise a fix for it. Avoid the temptation to slap a patch on it and move on. Ask yourself whether the bug was a coding error, like a misspelled variable or interchanged method parameters, or a design error, like an underspecified or insufficient interface. Design errors may suggest that you step back and revisit your design, or at the very least consider all the other clients of the failing interface to see if they suffer from the bug too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look for related bugs, and newly-created ones.** Think about whether any similar bugs might appear elsewhere in your code. If I just found a divide-by-zero error here, did I do that anywhere else in the code? Try to make the code safe from future bugs like this. Also consider what effects your fix will have. Will it break any other code?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Undo debugging probes.** In the course of finding the bug, you may have commented out code, added print statements, or made other changes in order to probe the program's behavior or make it faster to debug. Undo all those changes now, before you commit your fix to version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make a regression test.** After you have applied your fix, add the bug's test case to your regression test suite, and run all the tests to assure yourself that (a) the bug is fixed, and (b) no new bugs have been introduced."

    "Get a fresh view. This is another of Agans’ nine rules of debugging. It often helps to explain your problem to someone else, even if the person you’re talking to has no idea what you’re talking about. This is sometimes called [rubber-duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) or teddy-bear debugging. One computer lab had a big teddy bear sitting next to their help desk, with the rule that you had to “tell it to the bear” before you tried the human. The bear dealt with a surprising number of problems all by itself. Talking aloud about why you expect your code to work, and what it’s doing instead, can be good at helping you realize the problem yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the teddy bear doesn’t help, 6.031 staff and fellow students usually know what you’re talking about, so they’re even better to get help from. Outside this class, you may seek a fresh view from other team members, coworkers, or StackOverflow. The effort you put into minimizing your bug will help you make a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) that you can use to ask a question online. \n",
