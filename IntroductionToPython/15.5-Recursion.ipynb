    "# Recursion\n",
    "Recursion is an algorithmic technique in which the solution defines itself in terms of the solution itself. A recursive solution continually solves smaller and smaller instances of itself until the solution reaches a base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical point of view with programming, a recursive function is any function that calls itself. Indirect recursion exists when a function invokes another function before the original function is called again without any returns. Recursive solutions will have cycles (loops) within the call graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "That last paragraph brings back the concept of repetition.  Revisiting Python's loop statements (`while` and `for`), both had methods to be able to stop the loop somehow.  `while` has a condition check before we began each iteration of the loop.  `for` has an implicit end to iteration once the sequence completes. Similarly, for recursive functions, we need to define a base case that allows the repetition to stop.  This base case will be the simplest case of the problem itself: \n",
    "- _numerical_: when computing a numeric answer, the base case will be for 0 or 1.\n",
    "- _structural_: when processing data structures(lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.), the base case exists when that structure is empty or has no members of a particular type\n"

    "As a program makes function calls, Python must add a \"stack frame\" to keep track of the current function and its predecessors. This stack frame allows the interpreter to keep track of local namespaces for each function call. Before creating another “stack frame”, the interpreter checks how many instances exist – the number of function calls made without a corresponding return. If that number is beyond a certain threshold, then the Python interpreter assumes that a logic error has occurred, stops execution, and reports the recursion error. This \"depth\" is configurable. Other languages implement this check differently. For example, Java maintains a separate memory space and will have a memory error when the stack space is exhausted. The C and C++ standards do not specify a limit; the environment (operating system, other libraries, etc.) in which the program runs determines the available stack space.\n",

For printing a message, we track how many times the message has been printed (or, preferably, how many more times the message needs to be printed) and stop when that number is reached. The examples here will show both keeping track of a decreasing count as well as an increasing count.  By convention(and \"solving smaller instances of itself\"), programmers write recursive functions with decreasing values. Of course, we could use a `for` loop with a `range()` to print the message."

    "## Defensive Programming\n",
    "Defensive programming is the practice of writing code such that the code continues to function correctly even if used in a manner that was not originally intended or imagined. Defensive programming strives to reduce the number of potential problems by using slightly different logic that still meets the original intent.\n",

    "As mentioned, Python is a dynamically, strongly typed language. By dynamic, the types are determined at runtime. By strongly typed, the interpreter enforces which operations variables and expressions may participate based on type. In contrast, C, C++, and Java are statically typed. C is considered weakly typed as type checking is not strongly enforced - an assumption exists that programmers know what they are doing. C++ has much stronger type checking during the compilation process and is considered strongly typed. Java has both static checks during compilation as well as runtime checks. [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language) is most likely the strongest-typed language.\n",

This problem is probably the most used example to introduce recursion. We are leaving this as an exercise to the reader (literally and figuratively).\n",
    "2. Write a recursive function to compute the nth [Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).  This function should have the signature `fibonacci(n)`  Computing Fiboannic numbers is the other standard example often used for recursion.  Again, we leave it as an exercise for the reader.\n",
    "3. Sum a list. However, an element may be a number, a list, or a string. Ignore strings.To test if a variable is a string, use `type(variable_name) is str`; to test if a variable is a list, use `type(variable_name) is list`.\n",
    "4. Implement a modified version of the Linux command-line program tree as a recursive function. Below is the output. In this example, we called the function with the current directory as the argument. List the files and directories in alphabetical order. The number in parenthesis is the size of the file in bytes. At the bottom of the output, display the number of directories and files underneath the initial directory. Do not include the initial directory in the count. The final number is the total number of bytes allocated to the entire structure, including the initial directory. The starting point for the code should be the function  `tree(directory_name)`.  You can assume there will always be multiple files and directories. i.e., you do not have to special case the plurals for this problem. Show all files - including hidden files (those that start with a period).  Implementation note: to be able to reference a variable defined by an outer function within a nested function, use the `nonlocal` keyword.  This functions similarly to the `global` keyword used when discussing namespaces.\n",
