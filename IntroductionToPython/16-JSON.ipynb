    "# JSON\n",
    "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has become one of the Internet's most widely used data interchange formats. JSON is also the record format used by popular database management systems (DBMS) such as [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).  In addition, relational DBMSs such as PostgreSQL and Oracle DB now offer a JSON data type with support to query and index embedded fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, the home page for JSON on the Internet is at [https://json.org](https://json.org).  The Internet Engineering Task Force has also formalized JSON as a [standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259).\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is a text-based format derived from object literals of JavaScript.  Fortunately, these literals are nearly identical to those used by Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON contains four \"basic\" types (strings, numbers, Booleans, and null) and two structured types (objects \\[dictionaries\\] and arrays \\[lists\\]).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings follow the same definition as in Python - sequences of zero or more Unicode characters, except the literals use a double quote.  Booleans are identical, except `true` and `false` are not capitalized. Rather than using `None`, JSON uses `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates a possible phone book entry:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "{\n",
    "\t\"name\": \"Bruce Wayne\",\n",
    "\t\"address\": {\n",
    "\t\t\"street\": \"101 Wayne Manor Drive\",\n",
    "\t\t\"city\": \"Gotham\",\n",
    "\t\t\"state\": \"NJ\",\n",
    "\t\t\"zipCode\": \"12345-6789\"\n",
    "\t},\n",
    "\t\"occupation\": \"CEO\",\n",
    "\t\"alias\": \"Batman\",\n",
    "\t\"phone\": [\"212-234-5544\", \"212-456-8734\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the relative similarity between JSON and Python's literals, parsing JSON is straightforward within Python and creates the corresponding built-in objects as expected.  As part of its \"[batteries included](https://peps.python.org/pep-0206/)\" philosophy, Python has built-in support for JSON in its standard library within the [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) module."
