    "Yes, initially, you can get away with manually testing your software as your write code.  (And in some ways, this is necessary - build a little, test that those parts work, and build some more.  Rinse, Lather, Repeat.). However, eventually you will have significant maintainability issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the early 2000's, most software and system testing was a manual process.  Individuals wrote test scripts that were then executed.  Some unit test cases were built, but largely executed manually.  Since then, testing has been become automated (although not universally).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Several advantages to automated testing:\n",
    "1. Cost-savings.  These test cases can be run repetitively.  Yes, a higher upfront costs exists to develop test cases, but that's more of a one time expense.  Over the lifetime of a project, these test cases can now be executed thousands at time.\n",
    "2. Faster development timeframes.  As enhancements are made to system, existing test cases can be executed to ensure the existing functionality still works.  (regression testing)\n",
    "3. Immediate feedback\n",
    "4. automation of test cases development.  Fuzzing - https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing\n",
    "5. Automated testing is to foundation to continuous integration, continuous delivery, and other modern [DevOps practices](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/).\n",
    "6. Oh...  by the way, the automated grading of your program submissions - that's all unit tests."

    "3. Think about boundaries. If a function behaves differently around a particular boundary or threshold, test exactly that boundary case.\n",
