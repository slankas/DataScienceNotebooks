    "# Classes: Inheritance\n",
    "With inheritance, we can create a new class by extending an existing class. The new class inherits the existing class's attributes and methods (the members). We can then add attributes and/or methods. We can also modify existing attributes and methods to change functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we look around the world, we can find many instances of hierarchy in which specialized classes exist.  For example, the animal taxonomy serves to classify animals into different classes ([taxonomic ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank) based upon the different attributes that animals possess. Planes, cars, and trains are specialized cases of vehicles.  Circles, triangles, and rectangles are specialized cases of shapes. You can also view these examples using the phrase \"<i>is-a</i>\".  A train is a vehicle.  A circle is a shape. A dog is a mammal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, inheritance creates this \"_is-a_\" relationship among classes. We build a new class from an existing class. The existing (original) class is called a parent, superclass, or base class. The superclass is the more general class. The new class is called a child, subclass, or derived class. This new class is the more specialized class. The subclass becomes specialized by adding attributes and/or methods. The subclass can also become more specialized by modifying the existing state or behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we defined a BankAccount.  However, many different types of bank accounts exist: checking, savings, money market, brokerage, etc.  We also have transactions that can belong to those accounts.  Again, though, we have different transactions types: deposit, withdrawal, transfer, purchase, etc.  Then under deposit transactions, we have additional specialties: check, cash, ACH, etc.  Similar specialties will also exist for the other transaction types.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, consider different types of employees within a corporation. Corporations can have hourly employees, paid a fixed amount per hour and a specific multiplier for specialty shifts (holiday, weekend, nights). Corporations also can have salaried employees who earn a particular amount per pay period and commission employees who make a base salary per pay period plus a percentage of the gross sales they generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below diagram is a Unified Modeling Language(UML) class diagram. These diagrams document classes, their relationships to each other, and each class's members (attribute and methods). Each box represents a class. The top line contains that class name. The second area in the box contains the attributes, and the third area contains the methods.\n",

    "Objects of the `Employee` class have three attributes - an ID, a name, and a job title - and no methods are defined. The `HourlyEmployee` class extends the `Employee` class by adding attributes for the employee's hourly rate and the hours that the employee worked during the current pay period. The `HourlyEmployee` also adds behavior - a method to compute their pay. The `SalariedEmployee` class extends the `Employee` class by adding an attribute for the employee's periodic salary amount. For example, if an employee earns $\\$$120,000 annually and is paid twice a month, the periodic pay would be $\\$$5,000. The `SalariedEmployee` class also defines a method to compute pay, but this differs from the HourlyEmployee's behavior. `CommissionedEmployee` inherits the behavior and attributes of `SalariedEmployee` but adds an attribute to track their sales over the past pay period. Their pay calculation will \"override\" the `SalariedEmployee` class's pay calculation as they receive a salary plus a percentage of their gross sales."

    "At this point, we have implemented our base `Employee` class and have a robust set of test cases for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at defining the `HourlyEmployee` class. The following code block adds a few new details:\n",
    "1. We define `HourlyEmployee` as a subclass of `Employee`. Subclasses are defined similarly to other classes, except we add the parent class name inside of parenthesis at the end.  Syntax -\n",
    "   <pre>\n",
    "   class <i>ClassName</i>(<i>ParentClassName</i>):\n",
    "   </pre>\n",
    "2. In the initializer, we make a call to the parent class with `super()`.  As we have defined `__init__` in the child class, the interpreter does not automatically call the corresponding method in the parent class is not automatically called. Therefore, we explicitly call the initializer with reference to the superclass (`super()`). This call ensures our code performs the steps to initialize the base `Employee` type properly.  The `__init__` method then continues with setting the attributes specific to instances of `HourlyEmployee`.\n",
    "3. Note that in the initializer, we explicitly set `__hours_worked` to `None`. This statement defines that attribute. In `calculate_pay()`, we add a sanity check to our code to ensure `hours_worked` has a valid value with the `assert` statement.  Programmers can place a conditional expression within an `assert` statement. If the expression evaluates to `True`, processing continues normally. If the expression evaluates to `False`, the interpreter raises an exception.\n",
    "4. The `HourlyEmployee` class adds additional methods to support the `hourly_rate` and `hours_worked` attributes.\n",
    "5. In addition to the `__init__` method, the `HourlyEmployee` class also overrides the methods for `employee_type` and `calculate_pay`.  By overriding methods, objects of type `HourlyEmployee` will use the behavior for the methods defined within  `HourlyEmployee` itself. Any behavior defined in the parent class will not be performed unless explicitly called through the `super()` reference.\n",
    "6. Notice that the `HourlyEmployee` class did not change the `__str__` or `__repr__` methods.  In the test code in the following block, notice that when the `__str__` method gets the employee type, it calls the method based on the actual class. i.e., an instance of `Employee` returns \"unknown\" while an instance of `HourlyEmployee` returns \"hourly\"."

    "## Mixins \n",
    "A popular use case for multiple inheritance is to inherit from a particular class (a \"mixin\") that defines well-established methods and attributes (features).  Usually, only one feature exists in a \"mixin\" class.  This class does not share methods with any other parent class - this avoids the diamond problem.  The inheritance from \"mixins\" is not an \"is a\" relationship, but rather \"has behavior\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods in \"mixin\" classes are typically \"side\" tasks - sometimes generic in nature, such as logging or type conversions. However, the methods can also be specific to the problem domain, adding shared functionality to different classes. For example, a charting library could have mixins to deal with colors and legends.\n",

This implicit inheritance is `object` appears as the last item in the `mro()` calls above. This inheritance hierarchy allows for shared behavior defined among all created objects in Python - such as the ability to get the string representation."
