    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective programming involves combining problem solving skills, domain knowledge, and then programming skills.  The goal of these notebooks is not necessarily to teach you Python, but rather how you can solve problems and perform tasks with computer programs. These notebooks will target each of these different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learn to program, realize that learning to program is not a passive activity.  You can't simply just read documentation and these notebooks.  It will take targeted practice and that practice takes times.  These notebooks will present fundamental concepts and then how those concepts are implemented in Python as well as how you can solve real problems with those concepts.  These notebooks contain a large number of sample code.  Not only should you run this could, you should also make changes to the code and see what happens.  Don't be afraid to make mistakes - try things!.  The computer doesn't care and won't make fun of you.  You should complete the exercises at the end of each notebook.  Yes, we have provided the answers.  However, you will really learn by attempting the exercises on your own.  These exercises have also been written to reinforce the concepts presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll present an approach to solve problems with programming.  The key principle with this approach is understand what occurs and then how we can translate that into a series of steps.  And most importantly, to plan how to implement that approach before you start writing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, this notebook contains three separate programs to demonstrate some of the potential of computer programs as well as some fundamental concepts within computer science. As this is also one of the first Python programs you might have seen, we'll provide a detailed explanation of each step.\n"
