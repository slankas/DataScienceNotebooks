    "\n",
    "Effective programming combines problem-solving skills, domain knowledge, and programming skills; these notebooks will target each of these different areas.  The overall goal, though, is not necessarily to teach you Python but rather how you can solve problems and perform tasks with computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a series of instructions to carry out a specific task.  These tasks can run a large gamut of possibilities:\n",
    "- solving mathematical problems\n",
    "- processing images and text\n",
    "- playing video games\n",
    "- analyzing financial data\n",
    "- making decisions (which covers another range from answering simple yes/no questions to driving a car).\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program is not a passive activity.  You cannot simply just read documentation and these notebooks.  Becoming an effective programmer takes targeted practice, and that practice takes time.  These notebooks will present fundamental concepts, how Python implements those concepts, and then how you can solve real problems with those concepts. These notebooks contain a large amount of Python code. Not only should you run this code, but you should also make changes to the code and see what happens. Do not be afraid to make mistakes - try things! The computer does not care and will not make fun of you. You should complete the exercises at the end of each notebook. Yes, we provide many of the answers. However, you will learn more by attempting the exercises on your own. We have written these exercises to reinforce the concepts presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook presents an approach to solving problems with programming.  The fundamental principle is understanding what occurs and how we can translate that into a series of steps.  And most importantly, plan how to implement that approach before you write any code. Once we have those steps, we can then write code.  As you perform this process, you should have a paper handy to take notes and record your thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start our journey to learn computer programming through Python, this notebook contains three separate programs to demonstrate some of the capabilities of computer programs and some fundamental concepts within computer science. As these are some of the first Python programs you might have seen, we provide detailed explanations. We do not expect that you will now be able to write equivalent programs."

    "A few general notes:\n",
    "1. This code makes substantial use of existing modules and functions.  `webbrowser`, `json`, and `urllib` are modules - collection of code others have written that we can use in our code. One of the benefits of most programming languages is the libraries - both delivered as part of the programming platform (aka, \"standard libraries\") as well as those that others have written.  These libraries abstract many of the tasks to perform specific functionality and make doing those tasks much simpler than if we had to entirely write the system.\n",
    "2. Statements that look like _name_(_value_) are  function calls.  These function calls allow us to access code that has been previously written and performs a certain task.  \n",
    "3. Statements that look like _name_._name_(_value_) are also function calls, but these functions belong to modules."

    "* Lines 1 and 2 let the program use the `webbrowser` and `json` libraries.  The `webbrowser` library allows the program to open a new browser window with a URL (line 16).  [JSON](https://www.json.org/) has become one of the standards for exchanging data through internet-based APIs. The course will cover JSON in more detail in later notebooks. The `json` library provides code to parse the JSON data format.\n",
    "* Line 3 allows us to use the `request` module from the `urllib` package.  A package is a just a group of related modules. As you can see from these first three lines, one of Python's advantages is the large number of included standard libraries and available 3<sup>rd</sup> party open-source libraries.\n",

    "* Line 8 creates a variable called `url` to point to a location on Wayback Machine at https://archive.org/\n",

    "One of the keys to successful programming is to apply fundamental programming principles.  In this notebook, we have relied heavily upon two, abstraction and encapsulation, frequently appearing together. Abstraction seeks to distill a concept into its fundamental parts, while encapsulation hides the implementation's necessary and sometimes complex details. With abstraction, we focus on the outside view of an object or function, while encapsulation hides the exact details and steps to perform a specific task. For example, to query the Wayback Machine, many details were encapsulated by the `urllib` module. We did not have to concern ourselves with opening a network connection, following the HTTP protocol, and parsing the results. Instead, the `urllib` module handled those tasks with an abstracted (simplified) view to open a URL and read the response - the fundamental operations.\n",

    "We take advantage of abstraction, encapsulation, and other programming principles when we use existing classes, modules, and functions. As a result, we can solve real-life problems by focusing on the essential parts without understanding the precise implementation details. Throughout these notebooks, we will apply programming principles to model real-life systems, problems, and tasks."
