    "*aka Performing Tasks with Computers*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great satisfactions with computer programming is solving real-world tasks - especially when others can use our creations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to creating programs is to apply procedural programming.  In this paradigm, programmers create a list of instructions that computers must perform to solve a particular problem or perform a specific task.  For right now, we only consider small programs. However, as the course progresses and our programs become more extensive, we will adopt more techniques to approach those problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Introductory Notebook](01-Introduction.ipynb), the first task was to open a web page from the Wayback Machine.  Suppose instead that you needed to find the homepage from [The News & Observer](https://www.newsobserver.com/) from November 11th, 2018.  One way to begin to create an algorithm for this process is to utilize \"The Seven Steps\" [1] (The following description is inspired by \"All of Programming\" by Drew Hilton and Anne Bracy.)\n",

    "Step One is to work through one instance of the problem manually. Then, think through the various actions that need to occur and the order of those actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we could work the instance ourselves is to visit https://archive.org/.  Once there, we could enter https://www.newsobserver.com/ as the URL to search in the Wayback Machine. This search produces a timeline and calendar from which we can select a particular page.  So we click on 2018.  Then we click on November 11th in the calendar and select one of the dates.  Success!  The page refreshes with this URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20181111065826/https://www.newsobserver.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Two is to write these steps down using \"pseudocode\" - an informal, natural language (i.e., English, Chinese, etc.) description of how the program will work. Do not worry if you are unsure how this works yet - the course has plenty of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "1. Visit https://archive.org/\n",
    "2. Type https://www.newsobserver.com into the Wayback Machine and press \"Enter\" \n",
    "3. Select 2018 from the timeline\n",
    "4. Select November 11th and one of the dates from the calendar\n",
    "5. Wait for the browser to respond with the archived page\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you write these steps down, make sure you explicitly state everything.  Are there implicit steps/instructions missing? A computer cannot infer actions that our mind implicitly places into steps.  For example, in the above steps, how do I visit that website (open a browser window and enter the URL into the address/search bar). Many computer programming books like to use examples of recipes or knitting patterns to demonstrate the sequences of steps to be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Three involves generalizing our steps.  Our initial solution works for a specific site and date but requires manual intervention.  We need to search for ways to access the data programmatically. Often, sites provide an [application programming interface (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API#Web_APIs) to access data. Performing a web search on \"Wayback machine API\" leads to this page: https://archive.org/help/wayback_api.php. In reading this page, we see that the Wayback Machine has an API endpoint with URLs that follows this example: https://archive.org/wayback/available?url=example.com&timestamp=20060101\n",
    "\n",
    "In other situations, you will need to research the problem domain to understand of how something functions and how you can automate that process."

    "Cool. We now know how to access the Wayback Machine programmatically, but we still lack a general algorithm.  We have something that works for a specific problem, but we want to find something that works for all instances of this problem - any site and date.  This step examines why you performed your steps, what patterns may exist in the possible solution, and how to handle various inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize this solution, we need to pass the URL and date as inputs into the process.  Right now, we can just have the user enter these two values.  \n",

    "In Step Four, we then manually perform the steps to ensure we have a correct, working algorithm. We also need to test these steps by varying the inputs to see how our algorithm reacts.  This example is relatively straightforward, but in more complex situations, we will want to have at least some assurance that our approach is sound. Still, what happens if we enter an empty URL or date?  What if the URL does not exist in the Wayback Machine?  What happens if the date is in the wrong format? How does the program behave if our network connection is down?\n",
    "\n",
    "For all but the most straightforward situations, it is impossible to determine how many test cases are required: tests can demonstrate that defects exist, but they cannot prove that no defects exist.  Such proof requires formal verification using models and logical reasoning.  Hardware manufacturers are probably the leading users of formal verification in industry, but widespread use among software developers is practically nonexistent. As we discuss testing in later notebooks,  we will look at different ways to quantify the appropriate amount of testing required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Side Note: One of the fundamental questions within Computer Science has been to prove if an arbitrary program will halt for a given input. This problem, known as the [Halting Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), has been used to show other problems are equivalent to it and hence unsolvable.  Proving the absence of all defects is one such problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of these first four steps is to have performed sufficient planning to minimize and eliminate issues before we convert our steps into computer code and test that code.  This plan is referred to as \"design\".  Our \"requirement\" was to develop a routine to search the Wayback Machine for a particular URL and date, and then to open a web browser with the closest URL available in the archive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From a documentation perspective, the expected outcome should contain:\n",
    "* Inputs to the routine\n",
    "* Outputs from the routine \n",
    "* Pseudocode (steps in the routine)\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"outcome\" is this basis of an *algorithm*, which is a well-defined procedure (series of steps) that takes some input and produces some value or set of values (output).[2]  Following the steps precisely in the algorithm will solve a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode Guidelines: [3]\n",
    "* Use natural language statements that precisely describe specific operations\n",
    "* Avoid syntactic elements from the target programming language\n",
    "* Write pseudocode at the level of intent - document the approach to solve the problem\n",
    "* Write pseudocode at a low enough level that generating code from it is straightforward"

    "\n",
    "As you increase your coding skills, much of this process will become second nature, and you can minimize/combine steps. However, you should always spend an appropriate amount of time planning out your solution. This can just be a few scribbles or notes for more straightforward problems.  For more complex problems and large systems, you will spend a substantial amount of time researching the best approach and then documenting that approach."
