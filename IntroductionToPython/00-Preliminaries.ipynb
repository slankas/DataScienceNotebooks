    "The Jupyter environment follows a very familiar [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)) pattern - the main difference is the ability to execute code within the different cells.  Jupyter notebooks are composed of a sequence of cells.  Each of those cells can either be programming code or [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  You will need to execute all of the code cells - primarily in order, but you can modify and repeat running cells.  With the markdown cells, we will provide content (e.g., this cell), instructions, or exercises to perform. \n",
