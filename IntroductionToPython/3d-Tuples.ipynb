    "# Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are sequences of values just like a list - the biggest difference is that tuples are immutable while lists are mutable.  In other words, we can not modify the sequence of values - any change creates a new tuple object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike lists, tuples are hashable so we can use them as keys within a dictionary (to be covered) in a later notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple indexing, slicing, and comparison function identically to lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a tuple, use a sequence of values separated by a comma.  Although not neccessary, the Python convention is to enclose tuples in parentheses. (Makes identification of tuples easier while reading code).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you can see below, both the interpreter and `print()` output parenthesis when displaying lists."
