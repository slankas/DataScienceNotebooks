    "# Formatting Strings\n",
    "So far, we've been using string concatenation and multiple arguments to `print()` to format strings.  In this notebook, we will use both [printf style formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string) and [string interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) to put values into strings with a variety of different formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers three different ways to format strings:\n",
    "- old style (all versions of Pythons)\n",
    "- new style (Python 2.6 +)\n",
    "- f-strings (Python 3.6 +)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are directly printing the results of the formatting, but we can also assign the results to a variable or use as an expression (e.g., as an argument to a function)."
