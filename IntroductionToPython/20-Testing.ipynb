    "# Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform testing to increase confidence that our programs work correctly and that those programs meet our customer's expectations. We call this type of testing _functional testing_ as it ensures that the code functions correctly. While it sounds trite, the importance of software testing cannot be overstated.  Software and computer systems permeate our daily lives.  Unless you are reading these words from a dead tree off the grid somewhere, you are either working with a computer system or benefitting from a product (electricity) controlled by a computer system. Not only can software defects waste time as we work through the issues, those defects can lead monetary loss (both direct and indirect) as well as possibly deaths.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Testing directly improves the product quality which in turn leads to higher customer satisfaction with systems.  Imagine using a computer that crashed on a regular basis.  How long would you continue to use that system.  Testing also decreases product development costs as finding and fixing defects sooner to the time when they are introduced into the system costs lest money to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, initially, you can get away with manually testing your software as your write code.  (And in some ways, this is necessary - build a little, test that those parts work, and build some more.  Rinse, Lather, Repeat.). However, eventually you will have significant maintainability issues. As you make changes, how do you ensure those changes did not break something?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the early 2000's, most software and system testing was a manual process.  Individuals wrote test scripts that were then executed.  Some unit test cases were built, but largely executed manually.  Since then, testing has been become automated (although not universally).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Several advantages to automated testing:\n",
    "1. Cost-savings.  These test cases can be run repetitively.  Yes, a higher upfront costs exists to develop test cases, but that is more of a one time expense.  Over the lifetime of a project, these test cases can now be executed thousands at time.\n",
    "2. Faster development timeframes.  As enhancements are made to system, existing test cases can be executed to ensure the existing functionality still works.  (regression testing)\n",
    "3. Immediate feedback\n",
    "4. Automation of test cases development.  Fuzzing - https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing\n",
    "5. Automated testing is to foundation to continuous integration, continuous delivery, and other modern [DevOps practices](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/).\n",
    "6. Oh...  by the way, the automated grading of your program submissions - that's all unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will focus on verification of the code we have been developing - primarily this involves unit testing of the code we write. Generally speaking, unit tests check that the software produces the correct output based upon a specific input.  We compare actual and expected results to determine if an error occurred.  In terms of what exactly is a \"unit\", we consider this to be any portion of code that can be executed in isolation.  We can call functions and execute them, so functions are units. However, we cannot call specific lines within a function, so they are smaller than a unit.  As we get into classes, we will find that they have many pieces that can be tested in isolation. However, we can treat clases as units for testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk through developing test cases that can be run on an automated basis. Our overarching goal is two-fold:\n",
    "1. Deliver high-quality products to our customers\n",
    "2. Reduce costs as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python's built-in testing framework, `unittest`.  This framework provides capabilities to organize test cases, to execute code to setup any pre-conditions that may necessary to perform tests, and then code to remove any artifacts of the testing process.  The test cases work by making assertions about the code - generally does this result match some expected value. An assertion is a statement of fact<sup>[*](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/assertion)</sup>. As such, if that assertion does not hold, either our assumption is incorrect or the code produced an incorrect value.\n",

    "Force computation results to be too large or too small.\n",
