    "Files are one of the most ubiquitous abstractions for computers.  As users, we constantly interact with files to store our documents and other data.  We organize these files into directories (folders).  Directories can contain subdirectories to provide a hierarchical structure of various contents.  \n",

    "As with other programming languages, Python provides a rich set of functionality to interact with files and directories. Interacting with files will also be necessary to allow us to persist data. So far, we have just used variables that hold data in the computer's memory - such data will be lost when the program terminates.  By storing data in files, the information is placed (stored/persisted) on [secondary storage devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage#Secondary_storage) such as hard drives and USB sticks. \n",

    "##  Tricky Issues\n",

    "### Newline Characters\n",
    "One of the common issues when dealing with text files is that different platforms use different characters to signify a new line.  On Linux and MacOS, newlines are represented with just the bytecode `0x0a <LF> \\n` while on Windows, `0x0d0a <CR><LF> \\r\\n` represents a new line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within Python 3, the `open()` function has a parameter `newline` which controls how newlines are processed when reading in text files.  By default, universal newlines are enabled.  In this mode, lines can end with `\\n`, `\\r`, or `\\r\\n`.  Python will translate all of these to `\\n` before returning a value to caller.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When writing output to a file, any `\\n` characters are translated to the system default line separator, `os.linesep`, as the output is sent to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both reading and writing, there are additional modes to force how newlines are handled if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encodings\n",
    "Often times, text files can be created with different encodings to represent how text is stored for special characters (i.e., any characters that aren't ASCII).  By default, Python uses UTF-8 to encode files.   However, you may run across files stored in a different encoding (yes, Windows strikes again ...).  You'll need to figure out what the encoding and then open the file with by specifying the encoding argument to `open()` with the right value"
