    "Files are one of the most ubiquitous abstractions for computers.  As users, we constantly interact with files to store our documents and other data.  We organize these files into directories (folders).  Directories can contain subdirectories to provide a hierarchical structure of various contents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with other programming languages, Python provides a rich set of functionality to interact with files and directories. Interacting with files will also be necessary to allow us to persist data. So far, we have just used variables that hold data in the computer's memory - such data will be lost when the program terminates.  By storing data in files, the information is placed (stored/persisted) on [secondary storage devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage#Secondary_storage) such as hard drives and USB sticks. \n",

In this mode, lines can end with `\\n`, `\\r`, or `\\r\\n`.  Python will translate all of these to `\\n` before returning a value to caller.   \n",

    "When writing output to a file, any `\\n` characters are translated to tthe system default line separator, `os.linesep`, as the output is sent to a file.\n",

    "For both reading and writing, there are additional modes to force behavior if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encodings\n",
    "Often times, text files can be created with different encodings to represent how text is stored for special characters (i.e., any characters that aren't ASCII).  By default, Python uses UTF-8 to encode files.   However, you may run across files stored in a different encoding (yes, Windows strikes again ...).  You'll need to figure out what the encoding and then open the file with by specifying the encoding argument to `open()` with the right value"
