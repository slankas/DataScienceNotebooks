However, Lego master builders can produce truly novel models. They accomplish these builds through a deep understanding of how all of the different pieces can work together.

    "In Python, all data are managed as objects.  From a programming perspective, objects contain: \n",
    "- state (properties and values - things an object knows)\n",
    "- behavior (methods/ functions - things an object can do)\n",
    "- an identity (something that uniquely identifies that item).\n",
    "\n",
    "To help manage these objects, Python also tracks:\n",
    "- an object's type - this defines what an object can do and data it stores\n",
    "- a reference count that tracks how many other objects links to this object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other programming languages have the concept of a primitive type, which simply contains a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has a particular type that it is associated with.  That type determines what state (information) an object can know as well as what methods can be be called on that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, objects help us represent something. Initially, we will just use numbers and text. Objects can also be more complicated data collections - such as a list of items. In later notebooks, we learn how to build our own object types (classes) to provide abstractions (models) of the world we are trying to represent in our programs."
