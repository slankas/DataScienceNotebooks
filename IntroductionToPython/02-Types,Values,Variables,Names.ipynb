    "A computer program is a series of instructions that operate on data.  There are a number of building blocks you'll need to understand how to combine and manipulate to build effective programs.\n",

    "These bricks come in a large number of shapes, sizes, and colors.  Anyone can quickly start combining them together and novices can produce complex models while following instructions.  However, Lego master builders can produce truly novel models. Part of how they accomplish these builds is by having a deep understanding of how all of the different pieces can work together.\n",

    "Similarly, to become a proficient programmer, you will need to learn a core set of concepts (building blocks). These concepts are largely universal to many different progamming languages, they just vary with slight differences in syntax.

    "- behavior (methods/ functions - things an object can do)\n",

    "Every object has a particular type that it is associated with.  That type determines what state (information) an object can know as well as what methods can be be called on that object."
