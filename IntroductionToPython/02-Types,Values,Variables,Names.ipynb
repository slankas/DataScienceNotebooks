    "These bricks come in a large number of shapes, sizes, and colors.  Anyone can quickly start combining them together and novices can produce complex models while following instructions.  However, Lego master builders can produce truly novel models. Part of how they accomplish these builds is by having a deep understanding of how all of the different pieces can work together. They also spend a significant amount of time planning out their builds - just as we do when we document the algorithmic approach in the first four steps of the \"Seven Steps\".\n",
