However, Lego master builders can create truly novel models. They accomplish these builds by deeply understanding how the different pieces work together.

    "- behavior (methods/ functions - things an object can do)\n",

    "\n",
    "Practically, objects help us represent something. Initially, we will just use numbers and text. However, objects can also be more complicated data collections - such as a list of items. In later notebooks, we learn how to build custom object types (classes) to provide abstractions (models) of the world we are trying to represent in our programs."
