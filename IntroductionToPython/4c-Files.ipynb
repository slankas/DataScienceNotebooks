    "Files are one of the most ubiquitous abstractions for computers.  As users, we constantly interact with files to store our documents and other data.  We organize these files into directories (folders).  Directories can contain subdirectories to provde a hierarchical structure of various contents.  \n",

    "As with other programming languages, Python provides a rich set of functionality to interact with files and directories. Interacting with files will also be necessary to allow us to persist data. So far, we have just used variables that hold data in the computer's memory - such data will be lost when the program terminates.  By storing data in files, the information is placed (stored/persisted) on [secondary storage devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage#Secondary_storage) such as hard drives and USB sticks. \n",
