    "# Classes and Objects\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, everything in Python is an object. Objects are a special data structure that contains state (data/properties) and behavior (code/methods). Objects represent a unique, specific instance of something - typically what we think of as a \"noun\". The state models the attributes of that \"thing\", and the methods define the behavior and how it interacts with other \"things\" (objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook series started with imperative programming - just sequences of statements to execute. As we brought in functions - organized code blocks, reusing code to perform a task - we morphed into procedural programming. Procedural decomposition involves dividing a larger action into smaller actions. We used procedural decomposition to avoid code repetition where the same task was performed in multiple places in the same code file and reusing functions through importing modules. We also used procedural decomposition to provide structure. By treating several tiny steps as a unit, we abstracted that functionality and made it easier to remember and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a style of programming focused on objects. We create objects and tell them to do stuff by calling functions that belong to those objects. We typically refer to those object functions as methods. When two objects interact by calling methods and receiving return values, you may hear this called passing messages. The sending message is the method name and the associated arguments. The response message is the return value(s). With object-oriented programming, We reason about a program as a set of interacting objects rather than a set of actions(procedural programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are instances of a class.  A class describes a type of object we might create.  Classes correspond to nouns - for example, a general category of something like a bank account or a stock.  Classes then define the fields (state) that the object will have.  They also define the behavior by defining methods within the class definition. Methods declarations are just function definitions within a class declaration. A class forms a blueprint from which we create objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can organize data and functions into modules, we can only have one instance of that module. With classes, we can have virtually unlimited instances (objects), each with potentially different attributes but common behavior. "

    "\n",
    "First, we assigned a class attribute `balance` to BankAccount. Any created objects will automatically contain these class attributes with the currently assigned value. We can use a class attribute as a default value. Other uses of class attributes include storing class constants (e.g., the value of pi in a math class), and tracking data across all the instances (number of objects created, list of objects created, etc.)   While not a recommended practice, programmers can also add attributes to a class after it has been defined<sup>1</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we added an initializer method<sup>2</sup> `__init__()`. Within Python, we use initializer methods to establish a new object's state properly. As a general rule, an \"initialized\" object should be in a \"good\" state such that objects can use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This initializer defines two object attributes(state): account_number and customer_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the odd things to highlight with the initializer method is the first parameter, `self`.  Due to the design of the Python language, the first parameter to any object's method must be a reference to the object itself. By convention, programmers use the name `self` for this reference<sup>3</sup>. It is impossible to pass this argument explicitly - Python automatically supplies the reference to methods when the methods are defined as part of a class and using the <i>object</i>.<i>method</i>() call syntax<sup>4</sup>.\n",

More practically, we can view a _class_ as the code that specifies the attributes and methods for this set of objects. A _class_ serves as a blueprint when creating objects. Programmers can use the terms class, type, and data type interchangeably.\n",

    "\n",
    "A _message_ is simply a method call on an object.  This historical usage has declined over the past twenty years due to the emergence of distributed systems and the application of that term (message) to send information back and forth among independent processes. "

    "## Notes\n",
    "1. This is another example of Python expecting programmers to play nice together/be \"fully grown adults\". For example, we can add a new class attribute to BankAcount to track sign-up bonuses.  Any new objects instantiated from BankAccount will now have this attribute, while existing objects will not.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "BankAccount.signup_bonus = 50.0\n",
    "new_account = BankAccount(32315,543)\n",
    "print(\"new account\", new_account.signup_bonus)\n",
    "print(\"account\", account.signup_bonus)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "From a code maintenance perspective, tracking such ad-hoc attribute additions and changes becomes difficult.  Additionally, the value of these class attributes can be changed.  The class and any new objects will see the new value, while existing objects will be unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within Python, two steps are necessary to create an object:\n",
    "   1. Create a new, uninitialized object.\n",
    "   2. Initialize the object for use.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Python performs these two steps with `__new__` and `__init__`, respectively.  Except for  creating immutable types, you generally won't need to implement `__new__`.  Other object-oriented languages, such as C++ and Java, combine these two steps into one with a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Continue to use the name `self` for this purpose; other programmers will expect this convention.  Using a different name, while legal, will confuse those who have to maintain your code.  This may even be you, many months or years later.  Other programming languages such as C++ and Java use the keyword `this` and implicitly make the self-reference available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is possible to explicitly pass the object reference when we use the class as part of the method call:\n",
    "    <pre>\n",
    "    BankAccount.show_information(account)\n",
    "    Account #5345239: $0.00</pre>\n",
    "    This behavior demonstrates some of the inner workings of Python and how the language evolved. `account.show_information()` is a shortcut for the code above.  Removing this behavior would be a difficult undertaking as any Python code using classes would be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Again, another example of playing nice together.  The mungling pattern `_ClassName__AttributeName` is well known, and the updated names can still be easily discovered with `dir()`"
