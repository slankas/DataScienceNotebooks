    "Pac-Man also has another interesting issue when the player reaches level 256 - the screen becomes split with a jumbled mess. This was caused by the game using an 8-bit slot to hold the game level. At level 256, that value wraps around to 0 and the program didn't handle the overflow issue properly.  Back in 1980, memory was still a premium and every bit mattered.  Decisions like this came to haunt the software development community with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem'>Year 2000 Problem</a>.

    "<b>Fun fact #2:</b> One of the instructor's built a blackjack program for his 8th grade science fair project.  While testing the program, his mother noticed a pattern where the same cards appeared after the machine was just started; she could quickly build up a large bankroll by making the appropriate bets and plays. As mentioned, random numbers are really just pseudo random numbers for computers - there's a deterministic algorithm that produces them.  The key here is to use a random seed to change the starting point to an \"unguessable\" value.  Back then, the Applesoft Basic language didn't provide an automatic seed - one had to be explicitly passed to the function as a negative number.  To create the seed, the instructor put the blackjack program into an infinite loop and counted the number of times loop executed until the user hit the space key to start playing. Modern libraries utilize an automatic seed if one is not explicitly provided - either by using the current system clock or by using a special device /dev/random/ that collects entropy from the operating system based upon interrupts, network traffic, and other events.  Using the system clock alone as a seed can lead to issues as the range of possible values is finite - yes, it may be a large number of possibilities, but modern computers can \"brute-force\" those possibilities quickly.\n",
