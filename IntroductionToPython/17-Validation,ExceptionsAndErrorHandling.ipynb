    "\n",
    "As with any other programming technique, exceptions can be used wisely and abused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we should add exception handling anywhere an exception may occur. Nevertheless, we must catch and handle exceptions to resolve the underlying conditions. You should not just \"use an exception to pass the buck\". Instead, determine the best place to handle the error. Sometimes this will be as close to the error as possible, other times it will be where the data was entered that eventually let to the exception. For exceptions caused by input data (e.g., a user entered the wrong file name), then the exception needs to be resolved in a way that the user can correct the issue - this may be several calls up the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for production code, we may want to include a default handler at the very top of our processing code to catch possible errors. With a default handler, we can log these errors for future investigation.  Similarly, in processing loops for web applications, we may want to have a handle for the entry points. This handler can provide a more appropriate error message to the user and log unhandled exceptions."

    "When creating the exception, include all of the necessary details. For example, for an index out of bounds error with a list, you could document what variable held the list, the current size, and the requested index that was out of bounds.

    "While this section title seems long, it is ultimately the same underlying principle at work in different ways - checking if a condition holds or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building on top of the documentation for an algorithm, we can add two items: _preconditions_ to the routine and _postconditions_ of the routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Preconditions_ are conditions guaranteed to be true before the routine. These conditions\n",
    "include such things as inputs in appropriate ranges and files initialized and ready for\n",
    "input/output. _Preconditions_ are the client code’s obligations to the routine that it \n",
    "calls. For example, if we create a shape such as a circle or a square, the radius or \n",
    "side length must be a nonnegative number. As we write code, we should check that these\n",
    "preconditions hold. If not, an appropriate error handling technique is needed, such as\n",
    "logging the issue, returning an error code, or raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Postconditions_ are the conditions(items) guaranteed to be true before control returns to the caller. These conditions are the routine’s/class’s obligations to the code that uses it. For example, if a routine adds an element to a list, a postcondition is that the list is not empty. Or, more strongly, the length of a list is one more than the length of that list when the routine started.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Invariants_ are a set of conditions(assumptions) that must always hold true during the life of a program (or, more narrowly, by the life of an object). You can consider this to be a combined precondition and postcondition - it must be valid before and after a call to a method. However, while executing a routine that changes the relevant state/attributes for the condition, the invariant may not necessarily be true. Invariants should hold during the object’s lifetime - from the end of its constructor to the end of its destructor. (We will present the object's lifcycle  in a few notebooks.) As an example, the radius of a circle must always be nonnegative. We also apply the term invariant to a sequence of operations. In this user, the invariant is the set of conditions that remain true during these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Assertions_ are a series of statements used during development that allows a program to check itself as it runs. Think of an assertion as a statement of fact<sup>[*](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/assertion)</sup>. As such, if an assertion fails, our assumption is incorrect, or the code produces an incorrect value. We use _assertions_ as sanity checks that conditions hold true and to document assumptions we have made in the code explicitly. Primarily, we use _assertions_ as a development/debugging tool - it is possible to turn off these checks completely. Do not use assert statements for necessary checks (data validation, authorization). However, as we will see in a couple of notebooks, we will also use assertions for our tests."
