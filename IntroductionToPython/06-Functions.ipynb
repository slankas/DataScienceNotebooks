    "# Functions\n",
    "Most of the Python code that you have seen and written in these notebooks have been small fragments.  In some cases, these fragments can produce interesting and useful results such as computing compound interest.  However, it does not make any sense to constantly copy and paste these fragments into other programs.  Fortunately, Python provides a mechanism to organize these code blocks into a cohesive unit - the function.  We've already seen and used many of the built-in Python functions (`int`, `float`, `print`, `input`, `type`, `help`, `dir`), now we'll develop our own in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a named, reusable block of code.  They can take any number of parameters to send data into the function.  Functions can then return any number of results back to the calling block.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you use functions within your program, two fundamental concepts exist:\n",
    "1. Defining (declaring) the function.  This provides the function's definition: the name, parameters, and functionality.  In many other programming languages, you'll need to explicitly state the function's return type.\n",
    "2. Calling the function.  As we call (execute) a function, we pass a specific list of arguments to be used as the values for a function's parameters.\n"

    "- $r$ is the rate of interest expressed as a fraction; for a monthly payment, take the (Annual Rate)/12\n",

    "4) While the standard unit of measurement for mass is the kilogram, many different units exists for measuring mass (and weight).  Create a function called convert_mass that has three parameters: _value_ - the number for the current mass, _current_ - the unit currently used for the mass, _target_ the unit to convert the mass into.  The function should return the number for the current mass expressed in the _target_ unit.  Use the following values values for the possible _current_ and _target_ units. \n",
