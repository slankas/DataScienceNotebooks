    "# Functions\n",
    "Most of the Python code you have seen and written in these notebooks has been small fragments. In some cases, these fragments can produce interesting and useful results, such as computing compound interest. However, it does not make sense to copy and paste these fragments into other programs constantly. Fortunately, Python provides a mechanism to organize these code blocks into a cohesive unit - the function.  These notebooks have used many built-in Python functions (`int`, `float`, `print`, `input`, `type`, `help`, `dir`); now, we will develop custom functions in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are named reusable code blocks.  They can take any number of parameters to send data into the function.  Functions can then return any number of results to the calling block.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you use functions within your programs, two fundamental concepts exist:\n",
    "1. Defining (declaring) the function.  This provides the function's definition: the name, parameters, and functionality.  In many other programming languages, you need to state the function ºs return type and parameter types explicitly.\n",
    "2. Calling the function.  As we call (execute) a function, we pass a specific list of arguments as the values for a function's parameters.\n"

    "## Passing Arguments: By Object Reference\n",

    "\n",
    "If we pass a mutable object to a function, that function could change the object's properties (e.g., add an element to a list).  As we write functions, we need to avoid unintended side effects on objects passed to us or manipulate global variables.  \n",

    "In this next code block, the built-in function `id()` returns the identity of an object.  This identity is a unique integer.  When val is assigned 12, a new object is created and assigned to that parameter. `a` was unchanged as it is an immutable type. "
