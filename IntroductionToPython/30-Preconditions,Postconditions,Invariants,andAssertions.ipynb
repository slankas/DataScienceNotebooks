    "# Preconditions, Postconditions, Invariants, and Assertions\n",
    "While this title seems long, it is ultimately the same underlying principle at work in different ways - checking if a condition holds or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back to the original documentation we produced for an algorithm:\n",
    "* Inputs to the routine\n",
    "* Outputs from the routine\n",
    "* Pseudocode (steps in the routine)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add two additional items: _preconditions_ to the routine and _postconditions_ of the routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Preconditions_ are conditions guaranteed to be true before the routine. These conditions\n",
    "include such things as inputs in appropriate ranges and files initialized and ready for\n",
    "input/output. _Preconditions_ are the client code’s obligations to the routine that it \n",
    "calls. For example, if we create a shape such as a circle or a square, the radius or \n",
    "side length must be a nonnegative number. As we write code, we should check that these\n",
    "preconditions hold. If not, an appropriate error handling technique is needed, such as\n",
    "logging the issue, returning an error code, or raising an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Postconditions_ are the conditions(items) guaranteed to be true before control returns to the caller. These conditions are the routine’s/class’s obligations to the code that uses it. For example, if a routine adds an element to a list, a postcondition is that the list is not empty. Or, more strongly, the length of a list is one more than the length of that list when the routine started.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Invariants_ are a set of conditions(assumptions) that must always hold true during the life of a program (or, more narrowly, by the life of an object). You can consider this to be a combined precondition and postcondition - it must be valid before and after a call to a method. However, while executing a routine that changes the relevant state/attributes for the condition, the invariant may not necessarily be true. Invariants should hold during the object’s lifetime - from the end of its constructor to the end of its destructor. As an example, the radius of a circle must always be nonnegative. We also apply the term invariant to a sequence of operations. In this user, the invariant is the set of conditions that remain true during these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Assertions_ are a series of statements used during development that allows a program to check itself as it runs. _Assertions_ are sanity checks that conditions hold true. We use _assertions_ to document assumptions in the code. Primarily, we use _assertions_ as a development/debugging tool - it is possible to turn off these checks completely. Do not use assert statements for necessary checks (data validation, authorization)."

    "Assertions are an underutilized tool in many programmers’ arsenal. By documenting assumptions, asserts can help programmers identify situations that violate those assumptions. Pay careful attention, though, when using assertions - they are not a mechanism for detecting run-time errors, as they can be globally disabled through the Python interpreter. Also, do not use asserts to implement application functionality (e.g., data validation)."
