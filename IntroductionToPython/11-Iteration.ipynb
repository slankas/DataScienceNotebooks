    "# Iteration\n",
    "In previous notebooks, we discussed control statements (e.g., `if`) to make decisions on which block of code to execute. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a structured programming point of view, three basic building blocks exist to construct algorithms:\n",
    "- sequence (executing statements one after another)\n",
    "- selection (making decisions, control statements, `if`)\n",
    "- iteration (repeatedly executing parts of a program - also known as repetition)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks examines the last basic building block - iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, computers do not tire or complain of doing the same thing time and time again.  Many programming tasks are naturally repetitive.  For example, if we did not know the formula for compounding interest, we could simply execute the base calculation (adding the interest earned to the principal) a given number of times.  Painfully boring for us, just something else for a computer to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the Seven Steps, in the third step, we looked for ways to generalize our algorithm.  Finding repetitive patterns or behavior is another tool in this process.\n",

    "1. loop continues to be run as long a certain condition is true\n",
    "2. Set of instructions is repeated a fix number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will examine `while` statement as that is how Python implements the first type and then the `for` loop which roughly implements the second type."

    "## Looping with while\n",
    "The while loop is a relatively simple looping mechanism that allows us to repeat a code block as long as the condition for the while statement remains `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a fan of _Getting Things Done_ and you maintain a list a current \"to do items\" while you are at your computer.  A pseudocode example for processing that list might look like - \n",
    "```\n",
    "while todo_list is not empty\n",
    "  - remove the first \"todo\" from the list\n",
    "  - process the \"todo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the condition in this example is \"todo_list is not empty\".  In Python, we could simply use ```while todo_list:``` as todo_list evaluates to ```True``` if it has one or more entries and to `False` if it has zero entries.  Within each iteration of the loop, we remove an item from the list - so hopefully we will eventually finish that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop has the following syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    block\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements in the block are executed.  After the block executes, the entire statement repeats with evaluating the condition.  This repeats indefinitely until the condition evaluates to `False` or the block causes the flow of control to break out of the while statement.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "1. Write a function greater_than_x that takes two parameters: a list and a number.  The function should return a new list consisting of any entries in the list greater than the number.  Assume all entries in the list are numbers.\n",
    "2. Given this list of closing stock prices, create functions to compute the mean, median, and standard deviation.  Assume that we have a sample, but you can also write your function to make this an optional flag.\n",
    "```\n",
    "stock_prices = [ 123.75, 124.38, 121.78, 123.24, 122.41, 121.78, 127.88, 127.81, 128.70, 131.88]\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Generate a range that produces the following number 10,12,14,16,18, and 20.\n",
    "4. Create a guessing game.  Generate a random number between 1 and 100.  Have the user guess.  Print a message if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.  Repeat the user guessing until the correct answer is guessed.  Print the number of guesses.  You can use the following code to create the random number:<br>\n",
    "```\n",
    "import random\n",
    "number = random.randint(1, 100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Produce a compound interest chart for for 10 years using 1 to 15%.  The x-axis should be the interest with the y-axis being the years.  The numbers should be right justified.  Assume $100.00 is the initial principle.\n",
    "6. Read two strings from the user.  The first string is a text block.  The second string is a character, series of characters, or word to find within each word of the text block.  You should split the first string by whitespace and then keep only those words that contain the second string.  Join the remaining words together into a string, separated by a comma.\n",
    "7. Given the following lists, generated random sentences by combining random words from each list in this order: _article noun verb preposition artice noun_.<br>\n",
    "```\n",
    "article = [\"the\", \"a\", \"one\", \"some\", \"any\"]\n",
    "noun = [\"boy\", \"girl\", \"dog\", \"town\", \"car\"]\n",
    "verb = [\"drove\", \"jumped\", \"ran\", \"walked\", \"skipped\"]\n",
    "preposition = [\"to\", \"from\", \"over\", \"under\", \"on\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first word of the sentence should be capitalized and the sentence should end with a period. You can get a random element from a list with the following code: (the import statement only needs to occur once)<br>\n",
    "```\n",
    "import random\n",
    "random.choice(noun)\n",
    "```\n",
    "How would you repeat this 5 times?\n",
