    "# Iteration\n",
    "In previous notebooks, we discussed control statements (e.g., `if`) to make decisions on which block of code to execute. In this notebook, we will examine two Python statements to execute a given code blocks multiple times.  \n",

    "Fortunately for us, computers do not tire or complain of doing the same thing time and time again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Looping with while\n",
    "The while loop is a relatively simple looping mechanism that allows us to repeat a code block as long as the condition for the while statment remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are a fan of _Getting Things Done_ and you maintain a list a current \"to do items\" when you are at your computer.  A psuedo-code example for processing that list might look like - \n",
    "```\n",
    "while todo_list is not empty\n",
    "  - remove the first \"todo\" from the list\n",
    "  - process the \"todo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the condition in this is example is \"todo_list is not empty\".  In Python, we could simply use ```while todo_list:``` as todo_list evaluates to ```True``` if it has one or more entries and to `False` if it has zero entries.  Within each iteration of the loop, we remove an item from list - so hopefully we will eventually finish that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop has the following syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    block\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements in the block are executed.  After the block is execute, the entire statment repeats with evaluating the condition.  This repeats infinitely until the condition evaluates to `False` or the block causes the flow of control to break out of the while statement.\n",
