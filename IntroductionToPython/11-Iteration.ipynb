    "# Iteration\n",

    "From a structured programming point of view, three basic building blocks exist to construct algorithms:\n",

    "- iteration (repeatedly executing parts of a program)\n",

    "Fortunately for us, computers do not tire or complain of doing the same thing time and time again.  Many programming tasks are naturally repetitive.  For example, if we did not know the formula for compounding interest, we could simply execute the base calculation (adding the interest earned to the principal) a given number of times.  Painfully boring for us, just something else for a computer to do.\n",

    "  - process the \"todo\"\n",

    "So the condition in this is example is \"todo_list is not empty\".  In Python, we could simply use ```while todo_list:``` as todo_list evaluates to ```True``` if it has one or more entries and to `False` if it has zero entries.  Within each iteration of the loop, we remove an item from list - so hopefully we will eventually finish that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop has the following syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    block\n",

One possibility would be to just use the historical returns of the DJIA. Another possibility is to use random numbers from a Gaussian distribution defined with a given mean and standard deviation.  \n",
