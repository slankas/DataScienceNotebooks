Don't worry about these cases now.  In later notebooks, we'll examine how to make our code more robust through input validation and exception handling.  Conveniently in the next notebook, we discuss making decisions in our code with the `if` statement. The `if` statement would allow us to test if the interest rate equals zero and then compute the future value as the number of payments * payment amount."
